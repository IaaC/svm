                    OVERVIEW
                    
                    Otherwise known as Support Vector Machines, it is a machine learning algorithm that is able to classify multidimensional data using a hyperplane, that will divide nd separate the data points into clear and well defined groups.
                    
                    The term ‘Support Vectors’ refers to the points from the data groups that have teh shortest euclidean distance to the hyperplane, defining the margin, which defines how well is the model performing. The bigger the margin distance, the better the performance as the data groups will be well defined and the predictions will be more accurate.
                    
                    
                    OPERATION
                    
                    
                    In very simple terms, the process of execution consists in a series of operations where the hyper plane accommodates itself between data points until it finds the placement with the largest margin.
                    
                    SVM model can also operate with ‘non-splitable’ data by using a feature called the ‘kernel trick’. this hyper parameter allows us to make the data split by accessing a higher dimensional plane where the data can by separated by the splitting plane.
