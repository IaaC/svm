                    <h2>WHAT IS SVM?</h2>
                    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">     
                    From the name Support Vector Machines, SVM is a machine learning algorithm that can classify multidimensional data. This is done using a <span class="keyword" data-type="hyperplane">hyperplane</span>, which is essentially a decision boundary, that will divide and separate the data points into clear and well-defined groups.
                    
                    The term ‘<span class="keyword" data-type="support_vectors">Support Vectors</span>’ refers to the points from the data groups that have the shortest Euclidean distance to the hyperplane, defining a <span class="keyword" data-type="margin">margin</span>. This determines how well the model is performing. The larger the margin’s width, the better the model as the data groups will be well defined and the predictions will be more accurate.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                        <h3>OPERATION</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            In very simple terms, the process consists of a series of operations where the hyperplane is placed in different positions between data points until it finds the placement the separates the points into distinct groups and has the largest possible margin. In the following animation we can appreciate an extremely slowed down version of said process.
                        </p>

                        <canvas class="webgl2"></canvas>
                        <script type="module" src="./figure2.js"></script>
                        <button class="button" id="playButton">play</button>
                    </div>
                        <p class="paragraph">The SVM model can also operate with ‘non-splitable’ data by using a feature called the ‘kernel trick’. This hyper parameter allows us to make the data split by accessing a higher dimensional plane where the data can be separated by the splitting plane.

                    <h2>HOW TO USE SVM</h2>
                    <h3>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        First, as with any supervised learning algorithm, it is key to have a good dataset with no missing values. It’s also crucial that these values are either numerical or categorical or can be converted into those data types. To achieve this, libraries like Pandas and sci-kit learn offer multiple methods for data amputation and imputation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>HYPER PARAMETERS</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        To properly work with SVM (or any other algorithm in any case) it is necessary to understand what are the editable parameters that we can manipulate and how the inputted values affect our predictions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        <span class="keyword">C:</span> This might be the most crucial of parameters in SVM. It allows us to control the tolerance for misclassification of data points to achieve a greater hyperplane margin. A lower C value allows for a larger margin and more potential for misclassifications. A larger C value will do the opposite.
Grid Search and Randomized Search are common methods for tunning the c value.
